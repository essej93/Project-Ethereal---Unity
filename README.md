# livingsquare - Project Ethereal
This is a project that was worked on by a group of 6 Students. The game is a stealth platformer that was use to showcase a few main functions/features that we had created.

Majority of assets that were used were publically available from the unity asset store. The main character and animations were made by someone in the team.

All code was written by our project team.

Team:
- Jesse (Team Leader/AI design/Editor scripts)
- Josh (Character design/animation)
- Gardyan (First person controller/Core Mechanics)
- Lyon (Level interaction/Environment interaction/Menu)
- Nicholas (Level design)
